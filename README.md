## Overview

Here you can find the hardware design files, code and materials for assemblying a low cost and open source opto-mechanical device with the aim of acquiring multi-channel time-lapse images of bacterial colonies growing in agar plates.  

This device uses a system of addressable LEDs and fluorescence filters to estimate the spatio-temporal distribution of different fluorescently-tagged sub-populations from time-lapse images obtained using a standard DSLR camera with a macro lens.
